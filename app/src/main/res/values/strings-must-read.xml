        Due to regular bad ratings:
        \n1st: In the default settings, TimeLimit can be removed easily, even by children.
        If this is a problem for you, then get in touch with the support.
        \n2nd: If \"it does not work\" then this is most likely caused by power saving features.
        This features are often enabled even if you did not enable it actively.

    <string name="must_read_timelimit_rules">
        Because it happens often that it is configured wrongly:
        A rule limits the total usage duration of a category at the selected days of the week.
        If there is a rule from monday to friday with 3 hours,
        then there is a limit of total 3 hours per week from monday to friday.
        If there is one rule per day with 3 hours,
        then there is a limit of 3 hours per day.

    <string name="must_read_add_already_assigned_apps">
        Apps with category are removed from the previous category when they are added to a new category -
        use parent and child categories to \"add\" an App to multiple categories
